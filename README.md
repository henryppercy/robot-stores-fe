# Robot Stores Frontend

## About
 
This is a React front-end built for a fictional e-commerce store, 'Robot Stores', which sells Robot themed apparel. 

## Why?
This is serving as a place where I can continually work on my ability to build accessible, responsive, and visually appealing front-ends. My aim is progress to a feature rich e-commerce store which I can be proud to show off to employers on my journey as a Junior Developer. 

## Technologies 

    - TypeScript
    - React
    - Sass
    - Bootstraped with Vite
    
I am building this front-end in conjunction with a [backend](https://github.com/henryppercy/robot-stores-be) built with Node.js, Express.js and TypeScript. If you wish to use either of these two
